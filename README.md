    subject: <SUBJECT-OF-TRANSACTION>, // beware of special characters
    shortCode: <SHORT-CODE>, 
    notifyUrl: <YOUR-NOTIFY-URL>, // should be https 
    returnUrl: <YOUR-RETURN-URL, // should be https
    receiveName: <RECEIVER-COMPANY-NAME>,

  }
```
2. **Create instance of Telebirr class**
```
  let telebirr = new Telebirr({
    request: request, // the request object from earlier
    paymentUrl:<TELEBIRR-PAYMENT-API-URL>, // [production/test] url 
    publicKey: <YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>,
  });
